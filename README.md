# Interactive Data Visualization Tool - Java

Welcome to the Data Visualization Tool repository. This Java-based application is designed to help users create and display various types of charts, including pie charts, bar charts, and line graphs. The project leverages JavaFX and a variety of JavaFX libraries to deliver a dynamic and interactive data visualization experience.

## Features 

- **Pie Charts:** Easily create pie charts with customizable data inputs. Visualize the proportion of different categories within a dataset.
- **Bar Charts:** Generate bar charts to compare different categories or track changes over time.
- **Line Graphs:** Plot line graphs to observe trends and patterns within data over a period.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JavaFX

### JavaFX Libraries Used

- `javafx.application.Application`
- `javafx.scene.Scene`
- `javafx.scene.control.*`
- `javafx.scene.layout.*`
- `javafx.scene.chart.*`

## Usage 

- **Pie Chart:**  
  Input data points that represent different categories. Each category will be displayed as a slice of the pie, proportional to its value relative to the total.
  
- **Bar Graph:**  
  Compare different categories side-by-side, useful for showing differences in quantities or tracking changes across categories.

- **Line Graph:**  
  Plot data points to visualize trends over time, particularly useful for time series data.
